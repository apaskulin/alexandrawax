<section class='post-content'><p>Whenever I see a flock of birds moving and changing direction in perfect unison, it reminds
me of the magical nature of telepathy. Telepathy is often present in the nature of every day
things although it is sometimes not recognized as such. Even within the human body,
simultaneous communication between cells reminds us of telepathy’s natural reality.
Humans often employ telepathy subconsciously, acting on the information they receive
without consciously recognizing it.</p>

<p>American poet and novelist Jane Roberts began experimenting with a Ouija board in 1963.
She soon made contact with a spirit-entity known as SETH. Seth identified himself as a non-
physical personality essence and began to hold sessions in which he answered questions
about his identity and experience. Soon Jane learned to enter a trance state, allowing Seth
to speak through her. Roberts describes her trance experience as an expansion of
consciousness, not as losing control. When a spirit speaks through a medium it is known as
automatic speech. Along with automatic writing (in which a spirit guides the writing hand
of a medium to communicate messages), automatic speech has been used by humans
throughout history as a means of contacting the spirit world.</p>

<p>With the help of her husband Robert Butts, Jane and Seth jointly held sessions for over 20
years. The transcripts of Seth’s discussions about life, meaning, and the nature of existence
have been published in over ten volumes (in addition to Jane’s own prolific writing
career—14 books of poetry, novels, and nonfiction). Although there are thematic variations
between books, as well as a natural progression of complexity, each book can stand alone
as an expression of Seth’s overall worldview.</p>

<p>Of Seth’s spirit writings, The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events concerns itself with
the rejection of meaningless coincidence. Instead of a universe born from blind chance, an
invisible realm of ideas engenders the physical world that we then experience objectively.
Like a great, living skyscape, this foundational world holds patterns for the growth and
development of every cell of our planet. Oceans, rocks, animals, humans, and even chairs all
have their own invisible consciousness with their own emotions and intents. Thoughts and
ideas interact, change, and grow like clouds. Sometimes one psychological state will flood
an entire area, emerging in our awareness as a philosophical or religious movement.
Within this context, each consciousness has access to a much greater set of information
than we usually perceive. Time itself becomes blurred as each organism takes part in the
planning and creation of future events. Political movements, revolutions, and natural
disasters all have their origin within the realm of ideas before they erupt onto the physical
plane as mass events. This is possible because of the deep connections between all forms of
consciousness on deep unconscious levels. In her book on developing extra-sensory
perception, Jane Roberts argues that it is possible to allow ourselves to receive telepathic
communications by opening our minds to the greater realm of information underlying our
reality.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, every individual has had some previous experience with telepathy. It is a
natural part of existence. When you know exactly what a friend will say before they say it,
when you look at each other, knowing you each have the same thought in mind, these are
the surfacings of our latent telepathic abilities. Language, as an arbitrary sign system, rests
on a telepathic foundation. This is evident in the ease with which we converse with familiar
friends verses the difficulties in conveying complex meanings to strangers.
Inside the human body, instantaneous communication is a biological fact. Each cell of your
body is in constant communication with every other cell. As they share information, your
body responds, correcting imbalances with perfect simultaneity. This is telepathy occurring
at the cellular and atomic level, allowing your body to continue functioning like the perfect
system it is.</p>

<p>Your body contains more information than you are aware of. Without your consciousness
manipulation, your body heals and grows itself continuously. Every cell has memories,
plans, and capabilities of its own. You can feel this when you wiggle your toes, when you
look around, when you read these words. You don’t consciously operate each necessary
movement of muscle, tissue, and fiber. Your toes wiggle on their own because they know
how!</p>

<p>When trying to communicate using alternative pathways, remember that telepathy is easy!
It is a natural characteristic of your existence at every level. With atomic speed, your
thoughts explode outward from your mind, affecting anyone receptive to them. You need
only to open your awareness. In practice, receiving messages will feel a lot like impulsive
guessing, but with practice, your trust in your own instincts will improve and your natural
telepathic abilities will resurface.</p>
