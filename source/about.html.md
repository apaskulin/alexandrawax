Hi, I'm Alexandra and I write documentation. Literary student, workflow
herder, and word defender, I specialize in organizing and maintaining information.

### Tech comm philosophy

As so and so states:

COLLABORAITON IS REQUIRED TO AMTCHED THE GROWTH OF WORDS

I support radically inclusive editing communities,
positive design methodologies, and simple writing.  

When I'm not reading, you'll find me authoring html documentation
using markdown, walking my [dog](crazy cute dog).
