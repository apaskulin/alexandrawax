What are you doing here? Are you sure you’re ready for this? This isn’t going to be easy, 
you know. Well, since you’re here now, let’s begin.

My name is Alexandra and this is my digital home. I write, speak, breathe, and otherwise 
exist, mainly in physical form, but occasionally, I can be found here. 
In an attempt to major in magic at UCLA, I ended up in the English department and 
wasn’t disappointed.

When I say that I’m a writer, it means that the majority of my 
mental attention is devoted to the craft of language, specifically American English. 
My job is to write anything that needs to be communicated as clearly, concisely, and 
accurately as possible, so that it can serve as a baseline for future knowledge.

When I'm not [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7547650-a), you'll find me 
organizing information, authoring in markdown, or 
walking my [dog](https://apaskulin.github.io/waxtechnical/images/pup.jpg).

### Tech comm philosophy

As Ralph Squillace states:

![collaboration is required to match the growth of words](collab.png)

I support radically inclusive editing communities,
positive design methodologies, and simple writing.
