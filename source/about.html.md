I'm a technical writer and information architect specializing in American English.
When I'm not [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7547650-a) or writing, 
you'll find me walking my [dog](https://apaskulin.github.io/waxtechnical/images/pup.jpg)
around California.

I support radically inclusive editing communities, positive design methodologies,
and simple writing.
